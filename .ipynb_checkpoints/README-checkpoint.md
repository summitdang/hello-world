# First group project - 

Our program takes a name and an age as inputs. When the user enters a number for age, our if statement determines if the user is a child, teenager, or adult.

## How to run

Download "program.ipynb" and open it in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook. The program can then be run by using Shift+enter.

OR

Copy code and run it with a Python IDE or run with python command on command-line.

## Contribute

This repository can be forked by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

The forked repository can then be cloned to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.
Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```
Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:

```
git add .
```
Now commit those changes using the git commit command:

```
git commit -m "Add <your-name> to Contributors list"
```
Push your changes using the command git push:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing <add-your-branch-name> with the name of the branch you created earlier.
    
If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull` request button. Click on that button.
Now submit the pull request.
    
Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
